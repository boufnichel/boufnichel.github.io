title: Hybris hack...publish your hybris localhost
---

I can't test the connection with the PSP (payment service provider) since my hybris site is local and the server need a public ip to respond...
Google tag manager need a public site to be tested...
I will commit this feature without SEO impact analysis since my machine can't be scanned by an online tool, so let's put some fun on production...

I have heard all these speeches during my last 5 years with Hybris and since i'm  not a google CTO who have 25% of his time to do r&d stuff...
Recently i've discover that we was living on a IT hell all this time and there are a huge number of open source solution that allow localhost publishing
on the internet, here is 3 examples for solutions that allow this :

1. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) : Free
2. [forward hq](https://forwardhq.com/) : Business
3. [beame.io](https://www.beame.io/insta-ssl.html) : Opensource

And following an example of use :

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tunneling.gif)

Please share and enjoy !
